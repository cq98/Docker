- Video and Cheatsheet given at the bottom of the page quite useful
- docker-machine scp docker-compose.yml myvm1:~ [not given but found in video below]
- status has mixture of Shutting Down and Ready 
	- have issues removing redundant stack (yet to solve)
	- Needed: Running Status 
		- Got Ready instead of Running due to missing friendlyhello that needs to published into registry (Can be avoide  by not closing terminal that contains previous command
		from Part 1 & 2, if not, need to introduce the friendlyhello again)
- use docker-machine ssh <VM name> "Type command here"
	- if not, use new terminal for the use of VM only
